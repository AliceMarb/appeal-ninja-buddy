            <p><strong>RE: Appeal for Denial of Coverage</strong></p>
            <br>
            <p>Dear Appeals Department:</p>
            <br>
            <p>My name is ${formState.fullName}, and I am writing to appeal the decision to deny coverage for [treatment/procedure/medication]. I received a denial letter dated [date on denial letter], which stated that the reason for denial was [reason from denial letter].</p>
            <br>
            <p>I believe this denial is inappropriate for the following reasons:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The requested treatment is medically necessary as documented by my physician</li>
              <li>The treatment is covered under my policy according to section [X.X] of my benefits</li>
              <li>Similar treatments have been approved for comparable medical conditions</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            ${formState.medicalHistory ? `<p>My relevant medical history includes: ${formState.medicalHistory}</p><br>` : ''}
            <p>I have enclosed the following supporting documentation:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Copy of the denial letter</li>
              <li>Letter of medical necessity from my physician</li>
              <li>Relevant medical records</li>
              ${formState.policyDocument ? '<li>Copy of applicable policy provisions</li>' : ''}
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>According to the Affordable Care Act and state insurance regulations, I am entitled to a full and fair review of this denial. I request that you reconsider your decision and approve coverage for this medically necessary treatment.</p>
            <br>
            <p>If you require additional information, please contact me at [your phone number] or [your email]. I expect a written response to this appeal within 30 days, as required by law.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Sincerely,</p>
